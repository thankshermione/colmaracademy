Responsive website for a fictional modern school. Incorporating new skills in typography and colour design, and accessibility. (Codecademy project)

<strong>Design choices:</strong>

I chose the colour scheme for this project around the school's emblem, a lion. Representing courage and valor, I felt the logo had a regal feel to it. I decided on an analagous green and gold palette. However, seeing as the school hosts online courses, I brought these colours into the 21st century by using them sparingly on a light background and really letting that contrasting gold pull focus where needed.

I picked sans-serif fonts, keeping with the modernity of the school. 'Raleway' is an elegant font which, of course, really suited the profile of regality. 'Roboto' is an excellent complementary fontface (for 'Raleway') which has high readibility for longer pieces of text. There's also the added benefit of 'Roboto' having a friendly, approachable identity. This website is designed to attract new students, so I wanted the page to feel as welcoming and open as possible.
